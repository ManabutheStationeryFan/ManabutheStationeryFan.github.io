		<TD> Lotte Koala's March biscuit taste like normal cookies but inside of it there are chocolate which are very delicious. The good thing is that they are really easy to buy, it's almost every where around either Japan or Taiwan, and they are usually in the family market and 7-11. </TD>

	<TR>
		<TD width='10%' align='center'> Daifuku (大福) </TD>
		<TD> Daifuku is also really tasty, but they are not easy to buy as pocky or Lotte Koala's March biscuit. I usually see Daifuku around Japan in the souvenir store, and I would say they are quite rare to find, if you're just randomly wondering around. </TD>

		<TD width='10%' align='center'> Dorayaki (銅鑼燒) </TD>
		<TD> Dorayaki is one of my favorite Japanese food to eat, it taste really soft and inside it usually includes red beans that are very sweet, which is one of the most delicious part of eat a Dorayaki. People that knows "dora a mon", you've seen him eating bread and inside it include red beans, that's called "Dorayaki", which looks very different than other normal bread that you see on the street. </TD>

Brief History about the Japanese Food Souvenirs:

<FONT color='white' size='5' face='Noteworthy'>
In Japan people usually sit on tatami when eating their lunch or dinner. Also When you go the the Japanese restaurant in Japan their food will usually be organized pretty well and makes you really wants to eat it. The two primary staples for the Japanese diet are the rice and noodles. However my favorite food to eat and drink when I traveled to Japan are Ramen, Sushi, Mocha, Lotte Koala’s March Biscuit and Dorayaki. In addition the reason why Japanese people would stay alive for so long time is because they have healthy eating habits.
